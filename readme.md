# BinaryRage - the ultra fast .NET document database
BinaryRage is designed to be a lightweight fast document database for .NET. 
No configuration, no server, no setup - simply reference the dll and start using it in less than a minute.

## Goals
Codebase and usage must be as simple as possible (but not simpler).
